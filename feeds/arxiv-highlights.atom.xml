&lt;h1 id="This-week"&gt;This week&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#This-week"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a sketch this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been hearing hierarchical RL mentioned frequently lately, and while I understand it's a way to encode human expertise to achieve otherwise intractible goals, it has also seemed a bit like cheating. However, I have a day job, and this serves as a healthy dose of pragmatism. I also think that even when the goal is fundamental progress, it's often a good idea to achieve the goal &lt;em&gt;in any way possible&lt;/em&gt;, and then follow-up by working the cheats out of the system one by one. So when I read the abstract of this paper, I was feeling more receptive than previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of what made hierarchical RL seem not worth the cheating was how kludgy and inefficient the usual methods were, retraining a whole new policy from scratch for each subtask. That's why this week's paper caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... we propose an algorithm for learning both compound and composable policies &lt;strong&gt;within the same learning process&lt;/strong&gt; by exploiting the off-policy data generated from the compound policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their resulting algorithm, "Hierarchical Intentional-Unintentional Soft Actor-Critic" (HIU-SAC), efficiently trains all sub-policies simultaneously, choosing actions to perform in the environment using a weighted average of the "votes" of all sub-policies, with weights given by a learned selector network (which is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; simultaneously trained).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Composable-hierarchical-RL"&gt;Composable hierarchical RL&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Composable-hierarchical-RL"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="Architecture"&gt;Architecture&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Architecture"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hierarchical policy diagram" src="https://computable.ai/images/policy_network.png#right" height="300px" width="300px" style="margin: 10px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composite policy consists of the individual policy networks, each with its own reward function, trained to take observations $s$ in and output parameters of a conditional Gaussian. There is also a special activation vector selector network trained on the same states to produce weights corresponding to how much each constituent policy applies to the current state. All of these networks share early layers, since they all benefit from an accurate high-level state representation. Finally, some function $f$ takes all of these outputs and determines what action $a$ to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; take in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Q-value function diagram" src="https://computable.ai/images/q_fcn_network.png#left" height="250px" width="250px" style="margin: 10px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q function networks are similarly arranged, sharing early layers which take a state $s$ and an action $a$ to produce a Q function for each subtask, as well as a composite Q function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="Simultaneous-learning"&gt;Simultaneous learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Simultaneous-learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most methods learn the composable tasks one at a time, and later, the compound task. This procedure is not scalable as all the experience collected for each learning process is only used for that specific process. Also, it is not possible to start learning more complex tasks unless all the compos- able policies have been successfully learned. The method proposed in this section is based on the idea that a single stream of experience can be used to improve not only the policy that is generating the behavior but also, indirectly, many other policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors refer to the composite policy acting as the "intentional" policy (the "behavior" policy in an off-policy setting), and the composable sub-policies as the "unintentional" policies (each one a "target" policy in an off-policy setting). They use a variation on SAC to train the composite and composable policies simultaneously within the maximum entropy framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective function for the Q networks simply maximize the expected sum of all mean-squared Bellman errors for each Q network, for each tuple in the replay buffer $\mathcal{D}$. The objective function for the policy is simply the sum of the objective functions for each intentional and unintentional policy. Each policy objective optimizes the expected difference for each state in $\mathcal{D}$ between the Q value and log-probability of the selected action (adjustable by temperature $\alpha$), over all possible actions. HIU-SAC then alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement steps following SAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="The-importance-of-maximizing-entropy-to-adequate-exploration"&gt;The importance of maximizing entropy to adequate exploration&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-importance-of-maximizing-entropy-to-adequate-exploration"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the entropy-maximizing RL objective was &lt;em&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/em&gt; for exploring broadly enough to train all of these policies at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that populating the replay memory buffer with rich experiences is essential for acquiring multiple skills in an off-policy manner. The composable policies learned unintentionally had similar performance than the policies obtained in single-task formulations only when the compound policy was able to efficiently explore the environment. For this reason, the algorithm was built on a maximum entropy RL framework to favor exploration during the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="Parting-thoughts"&gt;Parting thoughts&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Parting-thoughts"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a way, the methods proposed here seem rather obvious, and I found this paper quite easy to understand given that it violated none of my expectations. I also haven't been paying enough attention to hierarchical RL to know off-hand why training the sub-policies in parallel off of the same recorded environment interactions hasn't been tried before (or whether it has been without my notice). Perhaps it was necessary for off-policy RL to reach a level of maturity sufficient for sub-policies to see enough relevant data to train? In any case, don't hear me faulting the authors for trying the obvious. It is relieving a &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-obvious that a straightforward formulation works so well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd love to see this work combined with imitation learning and inverse RL to figure out what sub-policies are necessary in the first place from demonstrations. That seems like a very practical framework for real-world learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="This-week"&gt;This week&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#This-week"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several paper caught my eye this week, but I'll be discussing only &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10247"&gt;Efficient Exploration with Self-Imitation Learning via Trajectory-Conditioned Policy&lt;/a&gt; in more depth. I'm choosing this paper because, as happens sometimes, I had this idea myself a few weeks ago. It's especially exciting to see something you suspected might improve the world fleshed out and vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the basic form of my shower-throught idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates the imitation of diverse past trajectories and how that leads [to] further exploration and avoids getting stuck at a sub-optimal behavior. Specifically, we propose to use a buffer of the past trajectories to cover diverse possible directions. Then we learn a trajectory-conditioned policy to imitate any trajectory from the buffer, treating it as a demonstration. After completing the demonstration, the agent performs random exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="The-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-problem"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://computable.ai/images/maze_icon_map.png#right" alt="Maze"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem the authors want to solve is insufficient exploration leading to a sub-optimal policy. If you don't explore your environment enough, you will find local rewards, but miss globally optimal rewards. In this maze (their Figure 1), you can see that an agent that fails to explore will collect two apples in the next room, but may miss acquiring the key, unlocking the door, collecting an apple, and discovering the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the notoriously difficult Atari game (for RL agents) Montezuma's Revenge, it is similarly extremely unlikely that random exploration suffices to explore the environment and achieve a high score. The authors report state-of-the-art performance without expert demonstrations on Montezuma's Revenge, netting 25k points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SOTA-without-demonstrations"&gt;SOTA without demonstrations&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#SOTA-without-demonstrations"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, more precisely, how did they achieve this, and why does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main idea of our method is to maintain a buffer of diverse trajectories collected during training and to train a trajectory-conditioned policy by leveraging reinforcement learning and supervised learning to roughly follow demonstration trajectories sampled from the trajectory buffer. Therefore, the agent is encouraged to explore beyond various visited states in the environment and gradually push its exploration frontier further... We name our method as Diverse Trajectory-conditioned Self-Imitation Learning (DTSIL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="The-trajectory-buffer"&gt;The trajectory buffer&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-trajectory-buffer"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their trajectory buffer $\mathcal{D}$ contains $N$ 3-tuples $\{\left(e^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)}, n^{(1)}\right), \left(e^{(2)}, \tau^{(2)}, n^{(2)}\right), \ldots \left(e^{(N)}, \tau^{(N)}, n^{(N)}\right) \}$ where $e^{(i)}$ is a high-level state representation, $\tau^{(i)}$ is the shortest trajectory achieving the highest reward and arriving at $e^{(i)}$, and $n^{(i)}$ is the number of times $e^{(i)}$ has been encountered. Whenever they roll out a new episode, they check each high-level state representation encountered against those in $\mathcal{D}$, increment $n$, and if $\tau$ is better they replace $\tau$ for that entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sampling"&gt;Sampling&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Sampling"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When training their trajectory-conditioned policy, they sample each 3-tuple with weight ${1}\over{\sqrt{n^{(i)}}}$. Notice that this will cause them to sample &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; frequently-visited states more often, encouraging exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Imitation-reward"&gt;Imitation reward&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Imitation-reward"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a trajectory $g$ sampled from the buffer, and during interaction with the environment, the agent receives a positive reward if the current state has an embedding within some $\Delta t$ of the current timestep in $g$. Otherwise the imitation reward is 0. Once it reaches the end of $g$, there is no further imitation reward, and it explores randomly. The imitation reward is one of two components of the $r^{DTSIL}_{t}$ RL reward, where the other is a simple monotonic function of the reward received at each timestep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Policy-architecture"&gt;Policy architecture&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Policy-architecture"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DTSIL policy architecture is recurrent and attentional, inspired by machine translation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by neural machine translation methods, the demonstration trajectory is the source sequence and the incomplete trajectory of the agent’s state representations is the target sequence. We apply a recurrent neural network and an attention mechanism to the sequence data to predict actions that would make the agent to follow the demonstration trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RL-objective"&gt;RL objective&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#RL-objective"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DTSIL is trained using a policy gradient algorithm (PPO, in their experiments), and RL loss&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathcal L^{RL} = {\mathbb{E}}_{\pi_\theta} [-\log \pi_\theta(a_t|e_{\leq t}, o_t, g) \widehat{A}_t]$$&lt;p&gt;where $$\widehat{A}_t=\sum^{n-1}_{d=0} \gamma^{d}r^\text{DTSIL}_{t+d} + \gamma^n V_\theta(e_{\leq t+n}, o_{t+n}, g) - V_\theta(e_{\leq t}, o_t, g)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SL-objective"&gt;SL objective&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#SL-objective"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each parameter optimization step, they also include a supervised loss designed to maximize the log probability of taking an action that imitates the chosed demonstration exactly to better leverage a past trajectory $g$.&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathcal L^\text{SL} = - \log \pi_\theta(a_t|e_{\leq t}, o_t, g) \text{, where } g = \{e_0, e_1, \cdots, e_{|g|}\}$$&lt;h2 id="Optimization"&gt;Optimization&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Optimization"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final parameter update is thus&lt;/p&gt;
$$\theta \gets \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta (\mathcal{L}^\text{RL}+\beta \mathcal{L}^\text{SL})$$
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; seeing methods developed for generative language models used in another context entirely, to generate another kind of sequence. I'm overjoyed that it worked well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need a high-level embedding for two reasons: first because storing entire trajectories exactly in memory is expensive, and second because it's quite difficult to re-execute a previously-encountered trajectory exectly, so in order for this method to work at all it's important that an &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; re-execution be possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id="This-week"&gt;This week&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#This-week"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's highlight is a paper on imitation learning: &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05634"&gt;Learning Self-Correctable Policies and Value Functions from Demonstrations with Negative Sampling&lt;/a&gt;, chosen again for pragmatic reasons. The problem my team is currently working on has both reasons for wanting high sample efficiency: training would be prohibitively slow without something to kickstart it, and actions taken in the real world can get expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I said I'd be experimenting with shorter, more bite-sized posts, but... next time. (If you want that, you can just stop reading after the "Key intuition" section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="The-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-problem"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning from demonstrations is more difficult than it may seem at first glance. The trouble mainly stems from covariate shift: the input distribution your agent will see in production is very likely to be different than that encountered during training. Many machine learning algorithms have this problem, reinforcement learning algorithms included, but imitation learning has it especially bad, for a simple reason: the expert demonstrations you are attempting to follow necessarily explore a very small subset of the state space. The whole &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of them is to stay on good trajectories, meaning bad trajectories never get explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agent can't in general figure out how to get back into the subset of state space where the expert demonstrations apply, even if it gets only slightly off-course, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value functions for states and actions are affected by unseen states, making it very &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; that the agent will wander off as soon as it's allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="Key-intuition"&gt;Key intuition&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-intuition"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors solve this problem by pre-training with supervised learning using a loss function that drives down the value of all states outside of those explored in the expert demonstrations $U$, by an amount proportional to their Euclidean distance from the closest state in $U$. In their own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a state $s$ in the demonstration and its nearby state $\tilde{s}$ that is not in the demonstration. The key intuition is that $\tilde{s}$ should have a lower value than $s$, because otherwise $\tilde{s}$ likely should have been visited by the demonstrations in the first place. If a value function has this property for most of the pair $(s,\tilde{s})$ of this type, the corresponding policy will tend to correct its errors by driving back to the demonstration states because the demonstration states have locally higher values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Figure 1 is a nice visual demonstration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://computable.ai/images/VINS_Figure_1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="VINS Figure 1" src="https://computable.ai/images/VINS_Figure_1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Self-correctable-policy"&gt;Self-correctable policy&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Self-correctable-policy"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first bit of their algorithm is the definition of their self-correcting policy. It's essentially a formalization of what we said above about $s$ and $\tilde{s}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If $s \in U$ (if $s$ is in the expert demonstrations), then $$V(s) = V^{\pi_e}(s) \pm \delta_V$$ ("just what the value would be in the expert demonstrations, plus some error").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if $s \not\in U$, $$V(s) = V^{\pi_e}(\Pi_U(s)) - \lambda \|s-\Pi_U(s)\| \pm \delta_V$$ (where $\Pi_U$ gives the closest $s \in U$, so $V(s)$ is "the value of the closest $s \in U$, &lt;em&gt;minus the distance to that&lt;/em&gt; $s \in U$, plus some error")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the induced policy from this value function is $$\pi(s) \triangleq \underset{a: \|a-\pi_{BC}(s)\|\le \zeta}{\operatorname{argmax}} ~V(M(s, a))$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $M(s,a)$ is a learned dynamical model of the environment that gives the next state given the current state and action. $\pi_{BC}(s)$ is the "behavioral clone" policy from the expert demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RL-algorithm"&gt;RL algorithm&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#RL-algorithm"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actually achieve $V(M(s,a))$ with the necessary properties, they select a state $s$ from the demonstrations, perturb it a bit to get $\tilde{s}$ nearby, and use the original state $s$ to approximate $\Pi_U(\tilde{s})$ in the following loss function.&lt;/p&gt;
$$\mathcal{L}_{ns}(\phi)= \mathbf{E}_{s \sim \rho^{\pi_e}, \tilde{s} \sim perturb(s)} \left(V_{\bar \phi}(s) - \lambda \|s-\tilde{s}\|- V_\phi(\tilde{s}) \right)^2$$&lt;p&gt;Finally, here's the algorithm that uses this and the earlier policy definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://computable.ai/images/VINS_Algorithm_2.jpeg#center" alt="VINS Algorithm 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;h1 id="Parting-thoughts"&gt;Parting thoughts&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Parting-thoughts"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought it was quite strange that they learned $V(s)$ and a dynamical model $M(s,a)$, and then used $V(M(s,a))$ in the algorithm. I thought, "Why not just learn $Q$?" The answer was given in their Section A appendix, and was quite interesting. I'm not sure it applies to our case, but it's important. TL;DR $Q(s,a)$ learned from demonstrations &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; is degenerate, because there's always a $Q$ that perfectly matches the demonstrations &lt;em&gt;and doesn't depend at all on&lt;/em&gt; $a$. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my coworkers (and upcoming Computable author!) wondered to me if the induced policy could be made explicit, by explicitly training a policy network to bring the agent back into safe territory. It could be trained with gradient descent, because $V(M(s,a))$ are just networks, and the technique for training deterministic policies just follows the gradient of the $Q$ function. I wonder too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="This-week"&gt;This week&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#This-week"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one paper this week, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04819"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; failed to catch my eye, but for brevity. Let me know in the comments if you agree that shorter or more focused articles are more attractive. So this week I'll be examining just one paper: &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00456"&gt;Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Implicit Human Preferences in Dialog&lt;/a&gt;. As with last week's papers, this week's is interesting to me professionally. Batch DRL is a way to solve the sample efficiency problem, from a certain perspective. It's mostly the online learning that costs too much when sample efficiency is low, so solving the problems that come with attempting to train offline might allow us to do many of the same things we could do if we had high online sample efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RL-for-open-domain-dialog-generation"&gt;RL for open-domain dialog generation&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#RL-for-open-domain-dialog-generation"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author's domain is dialog generation. They want to build a better chat bot, and they have quite a few recorded conversations. RL is good at refining these processes, but has a cold-start problem, plus they would certainly prefer to make use of the data they have on-hand. For this, they need to be able to make use of offline data, hence "&lt;em&gt;Way&lt;/em&gt; Off-Policy". This data is so off-policy it wasn't even &lt;em&gt;generated&lt;/em&gt; by a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they want to train DRL from samples acquired from some other control of the system (in their case, human interaction data), much like &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732"&gt;Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;. There are a couple of reasons this is important for others such as myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, since collecting real-world interaction data can be expensive and time-consuming, algorithms must be able to leverage off-policy data - collected from vastly different systems, far into the past - in order to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is often necessary to carefully test a policy before deploying it to the real world; for example, to ensure its behavior is safe and appropriate for humans. Thus the algorithm must be able to learn offline first, from a static batch of data, without the ability to explore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="A-generative-model-+-Q-learning"&gt;A generative model + Q learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#A-generative-model-+-Q-learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors first pre-train a generative model on the distribution of collected trajectories, and initialize the Q networks from this model. They then sample a fixed number of actions from it, and output the one with the highest Q-value as their policy's decision. In later reinforcement learning, they penalize their model for KL-divergence from this distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perform batch Q-learning, we first pre-train a generative model of $p(a|s)$ using a set of known environment trajectories. In our case, this model is then used to generate the batch data via human interaction. The weights of the Q-network and target Q-network are initialized from the pre-trained model, which helps reduce variance in the Q-estimates and works to combat overestimation bias. To train $Q_{θ_π}$ we sample &amp;lt; $s_t$, $a_t$, $r_t$, $s_{t+1}$ &amp;gt; tuples from the batch, and update the weights of the Q-network to approximate Eq. 1. This forms our baseline model, which we call Batch Q&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Overestimation-bias"&gt;Overestimation bias&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Overestimation-bias"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most deep RL algorithms fail to learn from data that is not heavily correlated with the current policy. Even models based on off-policy algorithms lik Q-learning fail to learn when the model is not able to explore during training. This is due to the fact that such algorithms are inherently optimistic in the face of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking the &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; of something (as in Bellman-equation-based algorithms), then the higher the variance, the higher the &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; value. This causes an over-estimation bias. We may have seen a really high value for some state once, so now we over-value that state, despite it being atypical. It may not be immediately obvious why this is a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;, but which states are we likely to overvalue? Precisely the states we haven't visited often. Why is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; a problem? This sounds good for exploration, right? But if we're trying to train our agent with canned data, it's important that the live agent stick pretty close to the states where the canned data does well, and it's counter-productive to have it believe that everywhere &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the pre-explored state space is worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular solution to the overestimation problem in Q-learning algorithms is to train &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; Q networks on the same data, put the input through both, and take the minimum value. This helps with the bias because they'll likely disagree unless we can be really &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; of the value of the input, and if they disagree we can go with the least confident. The authors of the current paper take a different tack, training a single neural net with dropout, and using the disagreement with different dropout masks as an estimate of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;h1 id="Parting-thoughts"&gt;Parting thoughts&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Parting-thoughts"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't talk much about their model architecture, which is "Variational Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder Decoder (VHRED)", largely because I think if I ever tried to make use of this directly I would employ transformers instead. They do mention that transformer architectures are a "powerful alternative", but they chose to work with hierarchical architectures so they could extend their work to hierarchical control in the future. That's interesting. In my own work at the moment, the important thing is the "way off-policy" part, not so much the chat bot part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very interesting to me that both of the methods for correcting overestimation bias make use of uncertainty estimators that I've seen mentioned elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09638"&gt;Estimating Risk and Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...we show that the disagreement between only two neural networks is sufficient to produce a low-variance estimate of the epistemic uncertainty on the return distribution, thus providing a simple and computationally cheap uncertainty metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142"&gt;Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article wasn't really shorter than if I had done multiple papers, less deeply. I'll have to practice at that, not least because it's time-consuming, but information is valuable. How does Adrian Colyer do this every &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="New-series"&gt;New series&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#New-series"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post begins a weekly series highlighting one or more RL papers in the previous week's cs.AI arXiv stream that caught my eye (making no guarantees about the correlation between what catches my eye and what ultimately turns out to be useful, important, etc). I'll be prioritizing sustainability over most other factors, but I do hope to show you some code from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read these papers to differing degrees as I have time, so there will likely be some variability in descriptive volume. However, I do pledge to make only justified statements about them so far as I know, and I welcome errata in the comments. I'm still experimenting with the format and voice, so please leave me feedback early and often to influence the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="This-week"&gt;This week&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#This-week"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this week's papers piqued my interest because of the sample-efficiency problem in modern DRL. Reinforcement learning algorithms need to interact with the environment quite a bit before they become good at a task, and anything that can shorten this time is of interest. My group is currently working on a learning task with a very low sample rate, so we are actively on the hunt for anything that improves sample efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12266"&gt;Growing Action Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, by Farquhar et al. at Oxford and Facebook AI Research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10187v2"&gt;Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist&lt;/a&gt;, by Woodward et al. at Google Brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06007v2"&gt;ProLoNets: Neural-encoding Human Experts' Domain Knowledge to Warm Start Reinforcement Learning&lt;/a&gt;, by Silva et al. at Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Growing-Action-Spaces"&gt;Growing Action Spaces&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Growing-Action-Spaces"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing Action Spaces proposes a form of "curriculum learning", where a more complex task is broken down into a sequence of simpler tasks, sometimes by humans, sometimes automatically. In this case, the authors improved the learning speed of their agent by initially giving it fewer actions to work with, training for a while, and then alternating between giving it more actions to work with and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they were working in Starcraft, which is a real-time strategy (RTS) game, where you have to control multiple units simultaneously in a coordinated fashion to achieve some goal. Thus, in their domain, the size of the action space didn't just come from continuity or a really large discrete action space, but from the fact that the actions they were capable of taking were &lt;em&gt;combinatorial&lt;/em&gt;. That is, they had to train an agent to take actions from a space including any combination of primitive actions, as well as any combinations of units; a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their solution is brilliant, and highly general: The authors broke the action space up into a hierarchy of action spaces by grouping units, and requiring that the same action be taken by all units within the same group. Then as training progressed, more groups were allowed to act independently. This resulted in a tractable problem at each stage of training, and overall high-performance policies that would have been prohibitively complex with conventional DRL algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or I want to apply this method to our own problems, the key requirement is to come up with a suitable way of breaking large action spaces into hierarchies of progressively smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Learning-to-Interactively-Learn-and-Assist"&gt;Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Learning-to-Interactively-Learn-and-Assist"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning typically depends on a sparse reward signal and random exploration, both of which contribute to poor sample efficiency in modern algorithms. One method of improving sample efficiency and solving the exploration problem is imitation learning, where the agent is pre-trained to mimic expert behavior. However, expert demonstrations are expensive, and it's often difficult to know how much and of what kind will suffice. These are the problems Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist attempts to solve by proposing a different paradigm entirely: without explicit demonstrations or reward function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is for an agent and a "principal" (say, a human) to learn to work together to accomplish the principal's purpose. The agent takes its cues from the principal's behavior, and acts helpfully. This requires prior understanding, both of the environment and of what constitutes communication from the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to this point, the authors trained an agent jointly with a "human surrogate" principal on a variety of tasks in the same environment. Each time, the principal knows the task (as part of its observation input), and the agent does not. They receive a joint reward at the end of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By informing the principal of the current task and withholding rewards and gradient updates until the end of each task, the agents are encouraged to emerge interactive learning behaviors in order to inform the assistant of the task and allow them to contribute to the joint reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior domain knowledge required to jointly accomplish a given task is trained into the agent ahead of time this way, along with the methods of communication. Actions and observations are restricted to the environment, so that later the principal may be replaced with a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ProLoNets:-Neural-encoding-Human-Experts'-Domain-Knowledge-to-Warm-Start-Reinforcement-Learning"&gt;ProLoNets: Neural-encoding Human Experts' Domain Knowledge to Warm Start Reinforcement Learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#ProLoNets:-Neural-encoding-Human-Experts'-Domain-Knowledge-to-Warm-Start-Reinforcement-Learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProLoNets stands for "Propositional Logic Nets", which are a neural network architecture and method of initialization that allows a domain expert to encode initial behavior for a DRL agent in the form of propositional logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you the flavor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this more practically, we consider the simplest case of a cart pole ProLoNet with a single decision node. Assume we have solicited the following from a domain expert: "If the cart's $x$ position is right of center, move left; otherwise, move right," and that they indicate &lt;code&gt;x_position&lt;/code&gt; is the first input feature and that the center is at 0. We therefore initialize our primary node $D_0$ with $w_0=[1,0,0,0]$ and $c_0=0$. We then specify $l_0$ to be a new leaf with a prior of $[1,0]$. Finally, we set the path to $l_0$ to be $D_0$ and the path $l_1$ to be $(1-D_0)$. Consequently for each state, the probability distribution over the agent's two actions is a softmax over $(D_0*l_0+(1-D_0)*l_1)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've barely skimmed this paper so I don't know what each of the components means, but I gather that a human-authored decision tree can be translated directly into a correctly-initialized neural network architecture, and an actor-critic algorithm takes over from there to improve beyond the human expert's baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our initialized ProLoNets are able to follow expert strategies immediately, they may lack expressive capacity to learn more optimal policies once they are deployed into a domain. ... To enable the ProLoNet architecture to continue to grow beyond its initial definition, we introduce a dynamic deepening procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon initialization, a ProLoNet agent maintains two copies of its actor: the shallower, unaltered initialized version and a deeper version, in which each leaf is transformed into a randomly initialized node with two new randomly initialized leaves. As the agent interacts with its environment, it relies on the shallower networks to generate actions and value predictions and to gather experience, After each episode, our off-policy update is run over the shallower and deeper networks. Finally, after the off-policy updates, the agent compares the entropy of the shallower actor's leaves to the entropy of the deeper actor's leaves and selectively deepens when the leaves of the deeper actor are less uniform than those of the shallower actor. We find that this dynamic deepening improves stability and ameliorates policy degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as the beginning of the future, where neural network architecture is learned and adjusted dynamically alongside the network parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I'm extremely pleased to have finally gotten this off the ground. Please comment on anything and everything, and we'll drive this thing together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing Action Spaces is immediately relevant to my group, since in the medium-term, we intend to increase our action spaces combinatorially, and will inherit all of the trouble this brings. More on this another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder how often in complex real environments the "Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist" agents will learn to communicate in a way that humans find unintuitive. Since the quickest way to communicate involves some compression, would we need to add some term representing human understandability? How best to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Learning to Interactively Learn and Assist" seems like a relevant paper for AI safety, though as far as I could tell in my quick read, it wasn't billed that way. If we train agents that don't have goals of their own necessarily, but take their cues from us in real time, are we safer than if we attempted to craft the perfect reward function, or demonstrated our desires in a one-and-done fashion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've gotta actually read the ProLoNets paper. There was even more to it than I highlighted, and they included an ablation study which will likely tell me if I can incorporate their concepts piecemeal into my own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
