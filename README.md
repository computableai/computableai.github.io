# Computable AI

This repository holds all of the source documents as well as output for [the Computable AI blog](https://computable.ai).

Any of the posts with Jupyter notebook sources can be run from here with Binder. Use the badge to launch a JupyterHub server inside the repo, and then find your post's Jupyter notebook source in `/content/{Category}`. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/computableai/computableai.github.io/dev)

Coming soon: Each of the posts in the blog will have a Binder badge as well, removing then need to hunt down the source `.ipynb`.
