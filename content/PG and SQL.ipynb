    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will dive into a lot of the math surrounding the gradients of different maximum entropy RL learning methods. Usually we work in the space of objective functions in practice: with both policy gradients and Q-learning, we'll form an objective function and allow an autodiff library to calculate the gradients for us. We never have to see what's going on behind the scenes, which has its pros and cons. A benefit is that working with objective functions is much easier than calculating gradients by hand. On the other hand, it's easy to lose sight of what's really going on when we work at such an abstract level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstraction issue is tackled in the paper `Equivalence Between Policy Gradients and Soft Q-Learning` (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06440), and I think it provides some pretty eye-opening insights into what the most common RL algorithms are really doing. I'll be working off of version 4 of the paper from Oct. 2018, the most recent version of the paper at the time of writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I'll walk through some of the basic definitions in the max-entropy RL setting, then I'll pick out the most important bits of math from the paper that show how entropy-augmented Q-learning is really just a policy gradient method."

    "# Maximum Entropy RL and the Boltzmann Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard RL, we try to maximize expected cumulative reward $\\mathbb{E}[\\sum_t r_t]$. In the max-entropy setting, we augment this reward signal with an entropy bonus. The expected cumulative reward of a policy $\\pi$ is commonly denoted as $\\eta(\\pi)$\n",

    "where $\\pi$ is our current policy and $\\alpha$ weights how important the entropy is in our reward definition. This intuitively makes the reward seem higher when our policy exhibits high entropy, allowing it to explore its environment more extensively. A key component of this augmented objective is that the entropy is *inside* the sum. Thus an optimal policy will not only try to act with high entropy *now*, but will act in such a way that it finds highly-entropic states in the *future*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses slightly different notation, opting to use KL divergence (AKA \"relative entropy\") instead of just entropy. This uses a reference policy $\\bar{\\pi}$, which can be thought of as an old, worse policy that we wish to improve on\n",

If $\\alpha$ is higher (i.e. we want more entropy), we move less in the direction of $e^Q$. The denominator is a normalization constant that ensures that our entire expression is still a valid probability distribution (i.e. the sum over all possible actions comes out to 1).\n",

If our policy is proportional to $e^Q$, it should also be proportional to $e^A$, so this makes sense. From now on, we'll refer to this policy as the 'Boltzmann Policy' and denote it $\\pi^B$."

The term in blue is quite simply the gradient used to minimize the mean squared error between our current value estimates and our value targets (the critic loss in an actor-critic formulation).\n",

The paper shows that the natural policy gradient in the max-entropy setting is equivalent not to soft Q-learning by itself, but instead to a damped version. In this damped version, we calculate a backed-up Q value and then interpolate between it and the current Q value estimate (basically using Polyak averaging instead of running gradient descent on a mean squared error term).\n",
