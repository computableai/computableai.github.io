title: About

Computable AI is a personal journal on machine intelligence intended to crystalize, internalize, share, and explain what I have learned about machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks, and especially through deep reinforcement learning.

I found few beginner resources for DRL when I began, and since I have a passion for teaching, I intend to make some dent there.

I also serve as the "Director of Applied Sciences" for a startup software company, and the machine learning team must occasionally indoctrinate new members. This provides me with a convenient target audience.

Finally, my own education in DRL is incomplete, so this will serve partly as a record of my own journey.

I hope it helps you.
