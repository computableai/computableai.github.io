title: About

Welcome to Computable AI blog, a machine intelligence blog from a handful of DRL practitioners, intended to crystalize, internalize, share, and explain.

I found few beginner resources for DRL when I began, and since I have a passion for teaching, this seemed a likely area in which to make a dent.

I also serve as the "Director of Applied Sciences" for a startup software company, and the AI team must occasionally indoctrinate new members. This provides us with a convenient target audience, as well as an expanding pool of co-authors.

Finally, my own education in DRL is incomplete, so this will serve partly as a record of my own journey.

I hope it helps you.
