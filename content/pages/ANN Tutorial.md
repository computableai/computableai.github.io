title: ANN Tutorial

This is a table of contents for posts explaining artificial neural networks (ANNs), arranged as a tutorial. Beginning with only some programming experience and some high school math, this should bring you to a practical understanding of what ANNs are, how they work, and how to use them.

This tutorial is a **work in progress** until all of the posts are published.
