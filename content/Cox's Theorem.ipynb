    "Today I'll be taking advantage of my stated intention to pull back from the stream of _recent_ papers, and look at some papers for their impact or fundamental importance as I see it. So today I'm doing something unusual, highlighting a paper not from last week, but from _four years_ ago, and not directly from AI, but from the field of probability theory: [Cox's Theorem and the Jaynesian Interpretation of Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06597).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been reading a book by E. T. Jaynes, called [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Science-T-Jaynes/dp/0521592712), a brilliant and practical exposition of the Bayesian view of probability theory, partially on [the recommendation of another AI researcher](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kXSETKZ3X9oidMozA/the-level-above-mine). The thoughts of an ideal reasoner would have Bayesian structure, so I am both personally and professionally interested in mastering the concepts."

    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Cox's theorem is an attempt to derive probability theory from a small, common-sense set of uncontroversial desiderata, and to demonstrate its uniqueness as an extension of two-valued (true/false) logic to degrees of belief. That's a big deal. As today's paper mentions, Peter Cheeseman [has called](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8640.1988.tb00091.x) Cox's theorem the \"strongest argument for the use of standard (Bayesian) probability theory\". But Cox's theorem is non-rigorous as originally formulated, and many people have patched up the holes for use in their various fields. Often today, if someone refers to \"Cox's theorem\", they usually mean one of the fixed-up versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jaynes' version unfortunately contains a mistake, and today's paper fixes it by replacing some of the axioms with the simple requirement that probability theory remain consistent with respect to repeated events.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be difficult without reading the book to see why this paper is important to AI, so perhaps in the near future I'll discuss that at greater length. For today, however, I'll simply be explaining each of the axioms, and setting you up to read the paper more easily. It is certainly worth a close reading, to ground your confidence in the interpretation of probability theory as a _logical system_ that extends true-false logic to handle uncertainty, so you can reap the associated benefits."

    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are multiple proposed interpretations of probability theory: one such interpretation is true-false logic under uncertainty. Cox's Theorem is a representation theorem that states, under a certain set of axioms describing the meaning of uncertainty, that every true-false logic under uncertainty is isomorphic to conditional probability theory. This result was used by Jaynes to develop a philosophical framework in which statistical inference under uncertainty should be conducted through the use of probability, via Bayes' Rule. Unfortunately, most existing correct proofs of Cox's Theorem require restrictive assumptions: for instance, many do not apply even to the simple example of rolling a pair of fair dice. We offer a new axiomatization by replacing various technical conditions with an axiom stating that our theory must be consistent with respect to repeated events. We discuss the implications of our results, both for the philosophy of probability and for the philosophy of statistics."

    "This paper proposes a new axiomatization of probability theory, with five axioms. As a variant of Cox's theorem, these axioms are supposed to represent a set of \"common sense\" desiderata for a logical system under uncertainty. That is, each of these axioms are things we naturally want to be true of any logical system under uncertainty. Cox's original axioms were more intuitively essential to me, however, so I'll also try to give justifications for demanding each of the following axioms, as well as explaining them technically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the ultimate goal is to _build_ probability theory up from a minimal set of absolute requirements for _any_ logical system. The punchline is that probability theory as described historically by greats like Kolmogorov turns out to be the _unique_ extension of true-false logic under uncertainty, and we can derive it from \"common sense\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the point that while we're writing these axioms we haven't yet got _probability_, following Jaynes I'll refer to our measure of certainty/uncertainty as \"plausibility\"."

This formalizes our requirement for continuity. Also notice that if $\\P (A_i | B)\\nearrow \\mathbb{P}(A | B )$ then $\\P (A_i | B) \\leq \\mathbb{P}(A | B )$, because our definition of sequential continuity also implies that the cardinality of the sets is non-decreasing.

It represents the demand that plausibilities of compound propositions be decomposable into plausibilities of the their constituents, and that that decomposition has a particular form. It's the demand that it follow a particular form that seems somewhat arbitrary to me at first. Of course we would want to be able to decompose compound uncertainty into more fundamental elements, or else probability theory wouldn't be very useful. But why should it take the form described of $\\circ$?\n",

    "The answer is that this form is _minimal_ for decomposability. That is, it's the weakest statement that could be made about the details of decomposition.

Every proposition $A$ in true-false logic has a unique proposition $A^c$ representating its negation, (This superscript complement notation emphasizes the representation as propositions as sets, but is equivalent to $\\bar A$, $\\neg A$, etc.) so it makes sense that an extension of true-false logic to uncertainty would also include a method of determining the opposite.\n",
