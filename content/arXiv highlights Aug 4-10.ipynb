    "# This week\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's paper, [Large-scale traffic signal control using machine learning: some traffic flow considerations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02673v1), caught my eye for several reasons. First, traffic signal control is relevant to my own group's work involving microservice and network traffic management. Second, the authors use cellular automaton rule 184 as their traffic model, which is actually the first time I've seen a cellular automaton used for something serious since [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/), despite that book's claim about the likely broad usefulness of simple programs for complex purposes. Lastly, the authors find that supervised learning and random search outperform deep reinforcement learning for high-occupancies of the traffic flow network,\n",
    "\n",
    "> For occupancies > 75% during training, DRL policies perform very poorly for all traffic conditions, which means that DRL methods cannot learn under highly congested conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "and that they recommend practitioners _throw away_ congested data!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our findings imply that it is advisable for current DRL methods in the literature to discard any congested data when training, and that doing this will improve their performance under all traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also have to admit that I've thought to myself, waiting at empty intersections for a light to turn green, that I could just _solve_ this problem with DRL. If I'm wrong, that would be very interesting and surprising."

    "# Considerations in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction and background are well summarized in their last paragraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In summary, most recent studies focus on developing effective and robust multi-agent DRL algorithms to achieve coordination among intersections. The number of intersections in those studies are usually limited, thus their results might not apply to large open network. Although the signal control is indeed a continuing problem, it has been always modeled as an episodic process. From the perspective of traffic considerations, expert knowledge has only been incorporated in down-scaling the size of the control problem or designing novel reward functions for DRL algorithm. Few studies have tested their methods given different traffic demands, or shed lights on the learning performance under different traffic conditions, especially the congestion regimes. To fill the gap, our study will treat the large-scale traffic control as a continuing problem and extend classical RL algorithm to fit it. More importantly, noticing the lack of traffic considerations on learning performance, we will train DRL policies under different density levels and explore the results from a traffic flow perspective.\n"

    "This is elementary cellular automaton (CA) rule 184. Elementary cellular automata operate on a binary vector, producing a new binary vector in each step that's a function of the previous one. For each entry in the previous vector, the new value of the corresponding entry in the resulting vector depends on the previous entry and its neighbors to the left and right. There are 256 possible rules with this formulation, and this picture is of the 184th rule set when ordered in the natural way.\n",

    "Rule 184 can be thought of as a flow of cars along a lane of traffic. Cars move forward (right) by one cell each step only if there is an open space in front of them, otherwise they wait for one to open up. Here's an example:"

    "Each traffic signal is managed by an agent, which has two actions it can take at any time step: turn the light red/green for the North-South approaches, or the opposite. The state observable by each agent is an $8\\times n$ matrix of bits corresponding to the four incoming and four outgoing CA vectors, and the output is the probability of turning the light red for the North-South approaches. Only one neural net is actually trained, and used by all agents, since there's no reason for them to be different in this formulation. For the DRL agent, the reward is the _incremental_ average flow per lane (not the average flow per lane), which the authors mention is lower-variance. The authors use a custom infinite-horizon variant of REINFORCE they call REINFORCE-TD."

They also note a previously undiscovered pattern that \"all policies, no matter how bad, are best when the density exceeds approximately 75%.\" How odd.\n",

The remaining columns show the flow-density diagrams obtained at different iterations, and the last column shows the iteration producing the highest flow at $k = 0.5$, if not reported on a earlier column.\n",

    "# Parting thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the end, I'm way more interested in the experimental setup of this paper than the conclusions. As usual, I learned a ton, and I may actually use rule 184 as a model for traffic flow on something.\n",
    "2. Isn't it _obvious_ given their problem formulation that the agents can't learn under conditions of congestion, since it means their input is essentially whited out? I would be more impressed with the conclusion if a neural net with complete visibility had trouble learning with congestion. It also seems to me _extremely_ suggestive that a supervised policy can learn from only two examples, and I would very much like to see if the major conclusions of this paper explode with a more realistic network topology. Queueing theory contains all sorts of counterintuitive surprises, and it seems likely to me that their results are more indicative of one of those surprises, rather than some deep fact about DRL's ability to manage urban congestion.\n",
    "3. It's interesting that they formulate the problem as a continuing one, against the prevailing trend in the traffic signal control literature. I agree with them, that even if you get to a state where there's no traffic, that's a function of the demand, not of the agent's choices. I bring this up because I too have found that it's _really quite important_ to recognize an infinite-horizon problem when you have one, or else your agent learns to rack up debts until the end of the artificial episode when all is \"forgiven\".\n",
    "4. It's fascinating that all random policies, no matter how bad, are best around 75% congestion. I have been admonished to avoid scheduling myself at more than 70% capacity to avoid the ringing effect. I wonder if this is an empirical vindication of that..."
