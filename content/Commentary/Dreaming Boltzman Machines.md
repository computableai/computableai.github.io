## Biological plausibility

"Biological plausibility" is a quality machine learning algorithms may have. If an algorithm is biologically plausible, it means it doesn't violate any of the constraints neuroscience tells us the brain probably has to obey, so it's a candidate model for how the brain may actually work.

It may surprise you to hear that although artificial neural networks take inspiration from animal brains, most algorithms that work well for training ANNs are _not_ biologically plausible, and are therefore not how the brain actually works.

## Boltzmann Machines

Boltzmann machines (BMs) are a kind of neural network that comes with a biologically plausible training algorithm. There are some caveats to this, of course, which is why it's only a _model_ of how the brain might work, but I think you'll agree that BMs share some remarkable similarities to animal brains: they sleep, they dream, and then they forget their dreams.
