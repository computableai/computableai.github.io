    "I recently read [The Miracle of the Boltzmann Machine]( https://theneural.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/the-miracle-of-the-boltzmann-machine/), and it's so compelling that I've been thinking about it ever since. The original post is quite beautifully succinct, and I intend to write much more on Boltzmann Machines in the future, but here I'm just going to show my work differentiating the objective function.\n",
